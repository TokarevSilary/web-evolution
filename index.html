<div class="text-block">
    <p>In the 1990s, web design was in its infancy, characterized by simple layouts, basic colors, and minimal interactivity. Websites were often built using basic HTML with inline styling and tables for structuring content. The design was heavily text-based, with limited use of images due to slow internet speeds. Backgrounds were frequently plain or featured tiled images, and fonts were typically default system fonts like Times New Roman. Navigation was straightforward, usually consisting of basic hyperlinks, as CSS had not yet been widely adopted. Animated GIFs and marquee text were common elements, adding a touch of movement to otherwise static pages.

        As the decade progressed, web design evolved with the introduction of JavaScript and early versions of CSS, allowing for more dynamic content and improved styling. Flash emerged in the late 1990s, enabling designers to create interactive animations and multimedia experiences. However, many sites remained cluttered, with dense text, bright colors, and excessive visual effects. Despite these limitations, the 1990s laid the foundation for modern web design principles, emphasizing accessibility, usability, and the potential for creativity in digital spaces.
